# Assignment_Advance_Regression
I have added two python notebooks, one excel sheet, one csv file and one pdf file while submitting this assignment.

Notebook 1: EDA_Completed.ipynb
	This notebook contains all the code that is written for EDA. At the end of this notebook, I am exporting all the final EDA data to a new csv called "model_data.csv". I have also added this csv file in the repository for reference

Notebook 2: Regularisaion_and_Question_Based_Model.ipynb
	This notebook contains all the code for model building. It also contains the code that is written for answering the questions asked in the assignment.

Excel Sheet: Ridge_Lasso_Linear_Regression_Comparison.xlsx
	There are multiple worksheets present in this excel sheet. Lot of analysis of the models that were built in notebook for comparisons and for answering questions is present in these worksheets

CSV File: model_data.csv
	As mentioned above, it contains the data that was derived during EDA activity and later used for model building
	
PDF File: Assignment_Question_Answers.pdf
